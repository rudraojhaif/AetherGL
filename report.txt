AetherGL Performance Analysis Report

Introduction
This report covers the graphics features I implemented in AetherGL and their performance impact. I tested each feature by turning it on/off in the Settings class and measuring frame times through logging.

Graphics Features Implemented

1. Physically Based Rendering (TerrainRenderer class)
- Implemented Cook-Torrance BRDF in fragment shader
- Added material properties for metallic/roughness workflow
- Performance impact: Noticeable frame time increase due to complex lighting calculations
- Check logs when toggling PBR in Settings to see the difference

2. Parallax Occlusion Mapping (terrain fragment shader)
- Added height-based surface displacement without extra geometry
- Uses multiple texture samples (8-32 depending on viewing angle)
- Performance impact: Major frame rate drop, especially at close distances
- Most expensive feature - consider making it optional for low-end hardware

3. Image-Based Lighting (TerrainRenderer class)
- Implemented IBL with irradiance and prefiltered environment maps
- Added BRDF lookup table for realistic reflections
- Performance impact: Moderate - requires multiple cubemap samples
- Memory usage increases due to large cubemap textures

4. HDR Post-Processing (PostProcessor class)
- Implemented HDR rendering pipeline with bloom effects
- Added tone mapping for proper color output
- Performance impact: Moderate - depends on screen resolution
- Uses additional framebuffers which increase memory usage

5. Volumetric Fog (fragment shader)
- Added height-based atmospheric fog
- Simple distance-based density calculations
- Performance impact: Minimal - just a few extra fragment operations

Performance Optimizations Done

1. Batched Rendering (TerrainRenderer class)
- Grouped OpenGL state changes together
- Combined uniform uploads in render loop
- Result: Noticeable FPS improvement

2. Matrix Caching (Camera class)
- Cache view/projection matrices when camera doesn't move
- Avoid recalculating same matrices every frame
- Result: Small but consistent performance gain

3. Delta Time Movement (Camera class)
- Frame rate independent movement system
- Smooth camera motion regardless of FPS
- Result: Better user experience on varying hardware

4. Early Exit Checks (TerrainRenderer class)
- Added validation before expensive rendering operations
- Skip rendering when conditions aren't met
- Result: Prevents performance drops in edge cases

Testing Method
I used basic frame time logging and RenderDoc for analysis. Toggle features on/off in Settings class and check the console logs for frame time differences. RenderDoc helps see draw call timings and memory usage.

Hardware Tested
Single test system with RTX 3070. Other hardware performance estimated based on this baseline.

Recommendations
1. Make Parallax Occlusion Mapping optional - biggest performance hit
2. Add quality presets in Settings class for different hardware
3. Consider reducing IBL quality on lower-end systems
4. HDR post-processing can be simplified for better performance

Conclusion
The engine runs well on mid to high-end hardware. The biggest performance bottleneck is Parallax Occlusion Mapping. All other features provide good visual improvement for reasonable performance cost. Check frame time logs when testing different settings to see the impact yourself.
